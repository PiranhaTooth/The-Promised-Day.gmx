/*

These scripts help you to draw graph curves. It does this by providing an 
input range and an output range, it will then transform where a point on 
the input range would fall between the output range. It actually goes further 
than that because that would be a linear conversion, this also converts 
points that do not have even gaps between the values. 

For a visualisation of these graphs use: http://easings.net/

You donâ€™t have to use these scripts, however these 1 or 2 lines of 
basic maths allows us to move things in a more fluid way.
